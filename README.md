# sa_deep

A repo for my project for ICMLA exploring transformers, deephit, and XGBoost for survival prediction using the ADNI dataset.

Essentially the plan is to build upon the work of http://proceedings.mlr.press/v146/hu21a/hu21a.pdf but with the ELSA dataset and comparing Survival XGBoost, Survival Deephit, Cox PH and the transformer model. I will also implement bayesian optimisation techniques for hyperparameter tuning and maybe wrap it in an outer loop of five folds for performance evaluation, depending on how complex the model is already.
